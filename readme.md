# Wave Simulator - 2D

[Work-in Progress]

[![Test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thenu-k/WaveSimulator/main/waveSimAnimation.gif)]

As of the latest commit, this programme simulates the 2D wave equation using finite differences with Dirilect boundary conditions. I'll be planning to add more features such as other boundary conditions, a wave generator, etc.
