This programme simulates the propogation of waves using the 2D wave equation via the fourier-spectral method. It can also solve it via the finite differences method.

To run the programme simply run the `main.py` file or by using `npm run start` if you have node installed.

### Methodology

The wave equation is a second order partial differential equation that describes the propagation of waves through a medium. It is given by:

```latex
\[
\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2
\]
