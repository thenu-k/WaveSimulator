As of the latest commit, this programme simulates the 2D wave equation using finite differences with Dirilect boundary conditions. I'll be planning to add more features such as other boundary conditions, a wave generator, etc. 

### Methodology

The wave equation is a second order partial differential equation that describes the propagation of waves through a medium. It is given by:
